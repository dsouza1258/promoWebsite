<h1> Ferrari </h1>
<h2>Ferrari F8</h2>
<p>Ferrari F8 Tributo. The Ferrari F8 Tributo is a mid-engine sports car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. The car is an update to the 488 with notable exterior and performance changes. It was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show.</p>
<h2>Ferrari 812 Superfast </h2>
<p> The 2018 Ferrari 812 Superfast is the latest model in a Ferrari lineage that can be traced all the way back to the 1960s: the V12-powered two-seater. ... The Superfast's 789 hp means it has 58 more horses than the already-amazing F12berlinetta, and the added horsepower gives the Superfast a performance edge.</p>
<h2>Ferrari Gtc4Lusso</h2>
<p>n a category full of two-seat supercar coupes, the GTC4Lusso politely requests a table for four. The lusty 6.3-liter V-12 makes 680 hp at an eardrum-tickling 8000 rpm. That power routes through a dual-clutch seven-speed automatic; Ferrari claims a 0-62 time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed of 208 mph.</p>

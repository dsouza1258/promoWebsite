<h2>Lamborghini Huracan
</h2>
<p>OVERVIEW
    The Huracán Coupé has been created for unprecedented performance. All the power and acceleration of a naturally aspirated V-10 engine, without giving up control or fun of driving. This is all thanks to the  all-wheel drive system and the 7-speed Lamborghini Doppia Frizione (LDF) dual-clutch transmission, as well as the innovative Piattaforma Inerziale Lamborghini (LPI), created for accurate and real-time detection of all the chassis movements and for immediate adjustment of the car setup.
    Below is a summary of all the characteristics and the technical specifications of the Huracán Coupé.</p>
<p>Engine. The Huracán maintains the 5.2-litre naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini V10 engine from the Gallardo, tuned to generate a maximum power output of 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS). To ensure its balance and performance, the car is mid-engined. The engine has both direct fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection</p>
<h2>Lamborghini Aventador </h2>
<p>OVERVIEW

    Forget the idea of performance you are used to. The Aventador Coupé has been engineered to revolutionize this concept and establish a new benchmark in the segment of super sports cars and beyond. This car aims to bring the future forward. This is a true supercar legend in the making, which combines the tradition of the Lamborghini brand with a level of innovation which takes the House of the Raging Bull to hitherto unexplored territory.</p>
<p>Engine
    The Aventador LP 700–4 uses Lamborghini's new 700 PS (515 kW; 690 bhp) 6,498 cc (6.5 L; 396.5 cu in) 60° V12 engine weighing 235 kg. Known internally as the L539,[10] the new engine is Lamborghini's fifth in-house engine and second V12 design. It is the first all-new V12 since the 3.5 litre powerplant found in the 350GT.[17]</p>
